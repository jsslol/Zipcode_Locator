# Zipcode_Locator
Simple program created to help a friend with their work so they wouldn't have to look up hundreds of zipcodes manually. OpenCage Geocode API was a free API used to create the program. This was a one time use program so it's a little rough around the edges in terms of operation. 
# How the program works
<ol>
  <li>The Parse file takes an input from a CSV file and outputs a list in a format that the Geocode API can use.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste the output from the Parse file into Zipcode_Locator, this will output a list of zipcodes</li>
  <li>Copy and paste the output from the Zipcode_Locator into makeCSV, this will create a new CSV and fill in the Zipcode to the corresponding coordinates</li>
</ol>
